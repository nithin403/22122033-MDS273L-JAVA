## Lab 1

## question
Write a Java Program that will collect an employee's basic details that fall into different data types and displays them.
After the details have been displayed, with the help of conditional statements, check if the gender of the employee is 'm' or 'f'. It should print "MALE" for 'm' and "FEMALE" for 'f'.
Assume that you can divide the states among India into different regions (North, South, Central, East, and West). If the employee is from the southern part of India, with the help of a switch statement, it should display "The Employee is from the southern states of India; Preferable work location is in <state>", along with the basic details.
Identify if the employee belongs to the top MNC Companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, IBM, Apple); if so, print a message "The employee is working in Top MNC Companies".
  
  
  ## Solution

1. Create a Java program that will collect an employee's basic details such as name, age, gender, address, and contact details using appropriate data types.

2. Use the System.out.println() method to display the details collected in step 1.

3. Use conditional statements (if-else) to check if the gender of the employee is 'm' or 'f'. If the gender is 'm', print "MALE"; if it is 'f', print "FEMALE".

4. Divide the states of India into different regions (North, South, Central, East, and West). Create a switch statement to check if the employee is from one of the southern states of India (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Puducherry). If the employee is from one of these states, display "The Employee is from the southern states of India; Preferable work location is in <state>". 

5. Identify if the employee belongs to the top MNC Companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, IBM, Apple). Use a conditional statement to check if the company name matches any of the above companies. If it does, print "The employee is working in Top MNC Companies".

6. Compile and run the Java program to test if it works as expected.
