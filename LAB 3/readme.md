Lab 3
## Question
Create a java program, that stores the details of a student (Name, Register Number, Email, Class, Department).

You can use a two-dimensional array to store the details.
HINT: String arr[] = {{"Alwin","1847207","alwin@christ.in","MCA","Computer Science"},{"Balagangadhar","2011204","bala@christ.in","MDS","Data Science"}}

You need to have functions to:
1)Collect the details of the student
2)Display the details of the student
3)Search the details of the student
4)With the help of a menu-driven main function, you need to access these functions inside your class and perform the operations.

Whenever you are entering the details of a student, you need to enter the value into a static global string array, that stores the names that the user has entered. Searching this array will help you to find if the details of the student are already entered into the program.
You will have a function to perform this search operation, which can be used to implement two functionality in the code
To check if the name is already entered
While searching for a name, you can identify the index of the two-dimensional array to print the details directly.

In the end, you will have
1)Four functions inside your lab program class including your main class
2)One static String array storing the names (note the program can store up to 1024 students)
3)One two-dimensional string array storing the details of up to 1024 students
4)A menu-driven main method implementing the functions and functionality

## Solution
1. Create a Student class with attributes: Name, Register Number, Email, Class, Department.
2. Create a static global String array to store the names of the students entered.
3. Create a two-dimensional String array to store the details of up to 1024 students.
4. Implement a method to collect the details of a student and add them to the two-dimensional array.
5. Implement a method to display the details of all the students in the two-dimensional array.
6. Implement a method to search for a student's details based on their name
7. Implement a menu-driven.
