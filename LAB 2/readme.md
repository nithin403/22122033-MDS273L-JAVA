## Question
create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:

1)Enter a name
2)Search for a name
3)Remove a name
4)Show all names
Note:

The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.

Constraints:

*)The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
*)The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
*)Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
*)Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
*)Format your results properly!!

## Solution
1. Create an empty String array of size 1024 to store the names.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of names currently stored in the array.
3. Use a do-while loop to display the menu and get the user's choice until they choose to exit.
4. Use switch-case statements to perform the appropriate action based on the user's choice.
    a. Case 1: Enter a name
    b. Case 2: Search for a name
    c. Case 3: Remove a name
    d. Case 4: Show all names
    e. Case 5: Exit the program.
