lab 2

create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:

1)Enter a name
2)Search for a name
3)Remove a name
4)Show all names
Note:

The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.

Constraints:

*)The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
*)The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
*)Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
*)Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
*)Format your results properly!!
