## Question
Below is an encryption/decryption standard in which the letters in the message will be replaced with the letters in the cypher row

Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG

Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that can encrypt or decrypt a message that the user wishes to transfer.
Your program should have two functions, one for encryption and another for decryption. Each function will accept a string message and return the encrypted or decrypted message.

## Solution
1. Create two String arrays, one for the plain letters and another for the cypher letters.
2. Create two functions, one for encryption and another for decryption
3. In the encryption function, loop through each character in the input message and replace it with the corresponding cypher letter from the cypher array. 
4. In the decryption function, loop through each character in the input message and replace it with the corresponding plain letter from the plain array. 
5. Create a menu-driven program that asks the user whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
